# AVTest_deliverable_1
Deliverable #1 - Develop specified simulation test scenarios and scripts for a specified route. 

The major objective of this task is to prepare each team to get familiarized with LGSVL simulator and Baidu Apollo platform. Each team must select maps and vehicles provided by the LGSVL simulator, and generate six Python scenario scripts for selected six test sample scenarios listed in the following six categories. A simulation execution report (for scenario scripts) must be generated using the LGSVL simulator and submitted to the specified group fold in the given submission link.
 
Submission Requirements:
-   	Scenarios and scripts
-   	Simulation execution report (generated using the LGSVL simulator)
-   	Scenario demo videos
-   	Selected scenario trip/route and map information

The six sample test scenarios will be selected from the following six categories.

Perform lane change/low-speed merge

Perform vehicle following

Move out of travel lane/park 

Detect and respond to school buses 

Detect and respond to encroaching oncoming vehicles 

Detect and respond to pedestrians
